    <p>These grilled chicken wings are always a hit! I grill them up before a party and keep them hot in a low oven. I always use Frank's RedHot sauce. It's got lots of flavor and isn't too spicy.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>10 Serving</p>
    <ul>
        <li>3 pounds chicken wings</li>
        <li>cut apart at joints, wing tips discarded</li>
        <li>½ cup soy sauce,</li>
        <li>½ cup Italian-style salad dressing</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter</li>
        <li>¼ cup hot pepper sauce (such as Frank's RedHot)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon soy sauce</li>
    </ul>    
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare wings: Combine chicken wings, soy sauce, and Italian dressing in a large resealable plastic bag; coat chicken wings with marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator, 4 hours to overnight.</li>
