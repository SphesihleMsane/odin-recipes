    <p>Simple and wholesome fruit popsicles. My mom used to help us make these when we were kids and I still enjoy them years later. Use honey as an alternate sweetener, and blend the fruit to be either chunky or smooth.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>8 serving</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups fresh blueberries, raspberries, strawberries and sliced bananas, mixed</li>
        <li>2 cups plain or vanilla yogurt</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>8 small paper cups</li>
        <li>8 popsicle sticks</li>
    </ul>   

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Place the mixed blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, sliced bananas, yogurt, and sugar into a blender. Cover, and blend until fruit is chunky or smooth, as desired.</li>
        <li>Fill paper cups 3/4 full with fruit mixture. Cover the top of each cup with a strip of aluminum foil. Poke a popsicle stick through the center of the foil on each cup.</li>
        <li>Place the cups in the freezer for at least 5 hours. To serve, remove foil and peel off the paper cup.</li>
